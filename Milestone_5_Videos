**Summary**
      In the standup meeting, we briefly connected on our current progress for each of our sections of the project by indivually answering
3 questions: "What did I accomplish today?", "What will I do today?", and "What obstacles are impeding my progress?". As a finished product
comes closer into view, what remains for our project is working out bugs, testing, optimization, and adding or changing features. Errors 
regarding the stream, database, and UI are discussed. We also talk about removing the date/time filtering in order to save on storage and 
time. New features such as adding specific sports searches are brought up as well.
